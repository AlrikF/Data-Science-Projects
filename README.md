# Collection of Data Science Notebooks 
Exploratory Analysis and data curation coupled with utilization of different  on a number of datasets on a number of datasets.
## 1) Housing 

## 2) Power plant data: (Regression)
   [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/294/combined+cycle+power+plant)  :: The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load.    Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to **predict the net hourly electrical energy   output (EP)**  of the plant.
   A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam    turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. 

   
   ##### NOTEBOOK 
   The notebook involves **EDA** for visualization and analysis of data as well as finding the significant features. 
   In addition algorithms utilized on the data are **Linear Regression**, **Multiple Regression** and **KNN** followed by a comparative analysis 

## 3) Random Forest and Trees (Classification)
   [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/421/aps+failure+at+scania+trucks) The datasets' positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS.

   ##### NOTEBOOK::
   The notebook involves **data analysis** and **data preparation**  such as exploring different methods for imputation of data, checking measures of central tendency and dispersion and checking for imbalance and outliers. 
   Various algorithms were adopted and tried  for classification such as Random Forest and XGBoost as well as Smote to resample and tackle class imbalance.
